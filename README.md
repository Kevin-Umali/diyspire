# Make Me Project

A platform that provides unique DIY (Do It Yourself) project suggestions using OpenAI. Explore a variety of projects, their materials, and step-by-step instructions to create them.

### **Disclaimer:** I won't be adding or updating this project any more.

## Structure

- **/client**: Contains the frontend of the platform. It allows users to navigate through projects, filter by category and difficulty, and view project details. [Client details](./client/README.md)
- **/server**: Contains the backend API responsible for fetching project data and managing interactions with OpenAI. [Server details](./server/README.md)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up both the client and server by following their respective READMEs.
